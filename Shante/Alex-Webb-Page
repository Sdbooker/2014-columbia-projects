<h1>Who Is Alex Webb?</h1>
				<img
			<p><strong>Alex Webb</strong>, born May 5, 1952, is a street photographer and photojournalist. His master understanding of light has allowed him to consistently create photos in <i>intense</i> color. Though he is recognized as a pioneer of American color photography, Webb didn't always shoot in color. He actually began shooting in color in 1978, after working in the Caribbean. The island was so vivacious and full of color that he found it difficult to capture its beauty in black and white.</p>
			<p>Webb studied history and literature at Harvard University, and photography at the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts. He was born in San Francisco, California and currently lives in New York City.</p>
