						Too Old to Be A Mother?

					<div class="sub">
						The story of Charlotte Gibson, and her journey to motherhood.

					<div class="p-1">
						<p><div class="drop">C</div></p><p>harlotte Gibson was rummaging through one of many boxes of clutter that engulf her one-bedroom apartment when Tatiana pointed to a burning Bronx building on News One nightly news, and said, &ldquo;look, it's my mommy's house.&rdquo; Gibson froze in a brief moment of panic&#44; unable to comprehend what she was seeing&#44; and immediately snapped back into reality.</p>
					
						<p>&ldquo;Tatiana, come over here and help me with this,&rdquo; said Gibson, 66, to her 5-year-old foster daughter, to distract her from the frightening sight.</p>
					
						<p>She was out running errands earlier that day when her foster agency called to say that Tatiana's mother, Luisa Rodriguez, had failed to check-in with them as she usually did each morning because her ex-boyfriend was stalking and threatening her. A fire had been reported at her Bronx apartment. Gibson later learned from the police that both Rodriguez and her infant daughter had been murdered by someone who then lit the fire to destroy evidence.</p>

						<p>&ldquo;I was in shock,&rdquo; Gibson said. &ldquo;I said: 'what?! Her mother is de&#8212;' and I didn't say anything else because I realized that she&rdquo;&#8212;Tatiana&#8212;&ldquo;was with me.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>Rodriguez's ex-boyfriend, father of her infant, had reportedly stabbed her multiple times, and then fled the apartment after setting it on fire. He was said to have stalked her for days. The agency and the police called Gibson several times throughout the day to make sure she and Tatiana were okay, since the suspect was still on the loose.</p>

						<p>&ldquo;They asked me do I feel threatened because I have her and he might come after her?&rdquo; But Gibson told the police &ldquo;I'm not going nowhere and she's not going nowhere.&rdquo; She and her foster daughter stayed inside for two days, &ldquo;until they caught him,&rdquo; she said.</p>

						<p>Gibson, a short and stocky woman, is single and has been a retired medical secretary for 13 years. She now finds herself apart of a growing trend among older women: adopting young children. While there isn't a single statistic to support this statement, there are several factors that make it truer today than it was 20 years ago. Kinship adoption, infertility among older 
					</div>

					<div class="p-3">
						<p>people who have chosen to pursue careers and have children later in life, as well as a push for older children to be adopted, may have all contributed to this trend, said Megan Lindsey. Lindsey is the Director of Public Policy and Education at National Council for Adoption, a nonprofit organization that helps create and support adoption policies and services.</p>

						<p>&ldquo;The awareness of the fact that nearly every child in foster care has faced abuse, neglect and trauma to some extent has increased the awareness that foster parents and adoptive parents from foster care need more training and education,&rdquo; said Lindsey.</p>

						<p>As a result, she says that she's seen a positive shift in adoption policies. &ldquo;States are realizing that impermanent placements are problematic—and we've always known that to some extent—but there</p>
					</div>

					<div class="p-4">
						<p>seems to be a renewed focus in the last several years in states like Colorado and Virginia. They're really focusing on getting kids into permanent settings, and that makes a difference,&rdquo; she said.</p>

						<p>With the recent lost of her mother, and no other living relatives coming forth to take her in, Tatiana's need for stability is high. And staying with Gibson permanently seems like the best option for her.</p>

						<p>&ldquo;The papers have finally cleared,&rdquo; making Tatiana free for adoption, so Gibson is currently working to make Tatiana her legal daughter. In addition to living off of her social security and pension, Gibson receives money from New York State Child Protective Services to take care of Tatiana, a monthly payment that will end when she turns 18. Since Tatiana's father gave up his parental rights years ago the adoption should be finalized in about six months, she says.</p>

						<p>It's been a year since Rodriguez's death, and while Tatiana still sees a therapist to cope with the trauma of losing her mother, the two of them have moved forward. Tatiana sleeps in a room decorated with Barbie dolls and Legos, while Gibson crashes in the living room on a black pull-out couch. They live in a Public Housing building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan where Gibson spent most of her childhood and moved back in 2004, after undergoing double knee surgery. She and her older sister Dolores Gibson, shared an owned townhouse in the Bronx for 20 years before Gibson moved back to Manhattan.</p> 
					</div>

					<div class="p-6">
						<p>The townhouse &ldquo;had so many steps, and I couldn't go up and down them,&rdquo; Gibson Explains. &ldquo;So, they offered me this apartment; they said it was a disability apartment.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>The apartment's living room, just three steps from its kitchen, is filled with stacks of clothes, paper and a large room divider covered with Chinese symbols. It looks like a beginning hoarder lives here, but Gibson had to move the boxes and clothing out of her bedroom when she became a foster mom in 2011.<p>

						<p>Her first foster children were a trio of siblings, two boys and a girl.</p>

						<p>&ldquo;I was shocked because it was my first time and I wasn't expecting to get three kids. I didn't know what to expect,&rdquo; she said.</p>

						<p>The children ranged from 10 months to age 4, and Gibson was told that she would have them for just a few days. Before she knew it, a few days turned into an entire year. Gibson, who has no biological children, enjoyed her experience and continues to enjoy motherhood with Tatiana. 
					</div>

					<div class="p-7">
						<p>Getting to know Tatiana's mother before her untimely death, and growing closer to Tatiana after it, is what made Gibson want to go the extra mile and adopt her.</p>
				
						<p>&ldquo;I became very attached to her&rdquo;&#8212;Tatiana&#8212;she said. &ldquo;I love her and I couldn't see her going somewhere else after living here.&rdquo;</p>
					</div>

					<div class="p-8">
						<p>Tatiana, just out of the shower, was trying to avoid bedtime. She would have to get up early for school in the morning, but ignored Gibson's requests by finding reasons to talk to her.</p>
			
						<p>&ldquo;I need something to wear tomorrow,&rdquo; Tatiana said.
					</br>
					</br>
						&ldquo;Find something to wear; you know what to wear. There are plenty of clothes in there,&rdquo; Gibson replied.
					</br>
					</br>
						&ldquo;How bout this with these pants?&rdquo; Tatiana held up a pair of jeans and a white blouse.
					</br>
					</br>
						&ldquo;There you go.&rdquo;
					</br>
					</br>
						Five seconds later Tatiana emerged in a purple nightgown plastered with cartoon characters, her long brown curly hair dangling past her shoulders. 
					</br>
					</br>
						&ldquo;Do you have my controller for the TV?&rdquo;
					</br>
					</br>
						&ldquo;Go to bed.&rdquo; Gibson insisted. &ldquo;You're not watching TV. Sleep baby.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>When Gibson was nine her mother became very ill. Her father did the best that he could to provide for her and her four siblings, but he eventually had to place them into foster care. Gibson was separated from two of her siblings and lived in the same house with the other two. Among those siblings was her older sister Delores, whose daughter Gibson helped take care of over the years.</p>
					
						<p>&ldquo;She spent a lot time helping me, especially when I was in the hospital,&rdquo; said Delores. Delores has Ulcerative Colitis, which caused her to develop painful stones in her stomach. &ldquo;She couldn't do much physically, but she was always there [for me] mentally.&rdquo;</p>
					
						<p>Dolores uses words like &ldquo;caring&rdquo;  and &ldquo;generous&rdquo;  to describe Gibson. They've formed a tag team to take care of their mother&#44; too; she's 94 and battling cancer in and out of Roosevelt Hospital.</p>
					
						<p>&ldquo;Charlotte lives closer to my mom, so she's always over there visiting and taking care of her when I can't,&rdquo; Delores said.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="p-10">
						<p>But Dolores notes that Gibson can also let loose and have fun. They used to go bar hoping every weekend when they were in their 20's.
						&ldquo;When we were allowed into the night clubs? Friday, Saturday night, that was dancing! If we had money we went,&rdquo; she said, laughing.

						<p>Gibson smiled as she recalled dancing on bars and hanging out at the Copa Cabana, a Manhattan nightclub, with Delores. She slowly rose from a wooden chair and searched through a box. &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; she said. She flipped through a thick photo album and pointed to a picture of herself, possibly, in her late 20's. &ldquo;I was in the afro phase,&rdquo; she said.</p>
					
						<p>Though she doesn't go clubbing as much as she used to in her 20's and 30's, she still finds time to let loose with her friends. The only difference is &ldquo;Now I have to think around the box&#8212;I have to think around her, &rdquo;&#8212;Tatiana&#8212; she said. &#34;I put her first and me second.&rdquo;</p>
